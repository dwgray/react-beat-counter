# flutter_beat_counter

A simple beat counter written in [React Native ](https://reactnative.dev/)

This simple application lets you tap out the beat of a song and find the
tempo in Beats per minute and Measures per minute. There are a couple of very simple
settings to change how you count (by measure or beat) and to specify the meter.

## The project

This is part of a larger project to compare and contrast multi-platform toolsets.

I've heavily documented the code I wrote, which is contained in [App.tsx](App.tsx) - the rest of the code in this repository is generated by the framework.

Screenshots of the application on several platforms are in the [screenshots](screenshots) folder

I am documenting this project in a series of [medium.com](https://medium.com) posts.  The first post in the series "[Which Multi-platform framework should I use to write my app?](https://medium.com/@dwgray/which-multi-platform-framework-should-i-use-to-write-my-app-f1afbf330493)" gives more context about the project and describes how the app should behave. The post that covers the Flutter implementation of the app is [Which Multi-platform framework should I use to write my app? Let’s try React Native.]([https://medium.com/@dwgray/which-multi-platform-framework-should-i-use-to-write-my-app-lets-try-flutter-2c39dedd3cd3](https://medium.com/@dwgray/which-multi-platform-framework-should-i-use-to-write-my-app-lets-try-react-native-8c563fc7f1dd))
