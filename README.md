# react-beat-counter

A simple beat counter written in react native

This is a simple application that lets you tap out the beat of a song and find the
tempo in Beats per minute and Measures per minute. There are a couple of very simple
settings to change how you count (by measure or beat) and to specify the meter.

## The project

This is part of a larger project to compare and contrast multi-platform toolsets when I've
made more progress I'll link the different versions and the blog here.
